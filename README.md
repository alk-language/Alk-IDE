## How to set up

#### Since ALKA-47 is still a work in-progress there are still no available executable to download, that means you will have to compile the code by yourself or run directly the python script.


## (Windows/MacOS)

First of all you have to install Python 3.x in your computer (recommended the latest version).  You can do that [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next step you'll have to get the wxPython module. Just open your command prompt and type the command bellow:

`pip -install -U wxPython`

Now you should be able to run ALKA-47.py scri[t directly using the PYTHON interpretor.

#### How to compile to executable

For that you will have to get pyinstaller with the following command in the command prompt:

`pip install pyinstaller`
